# Gray-Scott model

This repository contains examples of the Gray-Scott model in various programming languages.

## Governing equations

The Gray-Scott model represents the following irreversible reactions where $P$ is an inert product:

```math
\begin{align}
    U + 2V &\rightarrow 3V \\
    V &\rightarrow P
\end{align}
```

The resulting reaction-diffusion equations in dimensionless units are shown below where $k$ is the dimensionless rate constant of the second reaction and $F$ is the dimensionless feed rate. The diffusion coefficients are $D_u$ and $D_v$ and $\nabla^2$ represents the Laplacian operator.

```math
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial U}{\partial t} &= D_u \nabla^2 U - U V^2 + F (1 - U) \\
    \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} &= D_v \nabla^2 V + U V^2 - (F + k) V
\end{align}
```

## Examples

Examples of solving the Gray-Scott model are provided for the following programming languages:

- Python
- Swift (in progress)
- Julia (in progress)

**python-examples** - These Python examples use NumPy or SciPy to solve the Gray-Scott model. A five-point stencil is used to approximate the Laplacian. Results are plotted with the Matplotlib package. See the comments in the code files for more information. The examples use model parameters and boundary conditions defined in the Pearson 1993 article.
